Web3 Healthcare System
The Web3 Healthcare System is a decentralized, blockchain-powered platform designed to revolutionize healthcare savings by incentivizing users through a gamified model. The platform allows users to save funds for healthcare expenses securely and transparently while earning rewards. This project is built with React for the front-end and Solidity for the smart contract logic.

Key Features
Healthcare Savings Accounts: Users can save money in decentralized wallets for healthcare expenses.
Earning Rewards: Users can earn passive income through savings with a reward model that increases based on participation.
Transparent & Secure: Powered by blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and security in transactions and savings.
Technical Architecture
Frontend: Built using React, offering an interactive and user-friendly interface.
Smart Contracts: Developed in Solidity, the smart contracts handle user funds, reward distribution, and transaction validation.
Web3 Integration: The platform leverages web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for decentralized transactions and wallet connections.
Decentralized Storage: Critical data is stored on-chain for added security, while healthcare records or metadata could be stored using IPFS (future scope).

Smart Contract Details
The core smart contract is written in Solidity, covering:

Deposit & Withdrawal: Users can deposit funds into their health savings wallet and withdraw as needed.
Reward System: The contract calculates rewards based on the userâ€™s savings and time spent on the platform.
Security: Funds are protected using secure transaction protocols inherent to blockchain technology.
Solidity Contract Structure
Healthcare.sol: Manages user accounts, deposits, and withdrawal functionalities.
RewardManager.sol: Handles the calculation and distribution of rewards.
Contract Deployment
Smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum Testnet. Ensure you have an Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the contracts.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js: Install Node.js
Truffle: For smart contract deployment (if redeploying the contract).
MetaMask: Browser extension for wallet integration.
Steps to Run Locally
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AbdurRazzak01/HealthCare.git
cd HealthCare
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Interact with smart contracts by connecting MetaMask to the application.

Running Tests
The project includes a suite of tests for the smart contracts:

bash
Copy code
truffle test
Deployment
To deploy the smart contracts to an Ethereum Testnet (e.g., Ropsten or Rinkeby):

Configure your .env with your wallet private key and Infura endpoint.
Run:
bash
Copy code
truffle migrate --network <network-name>
Available Scripts
npm start: Runs the app in development mode.
npm test: Launches test runner in interactive watch mode.
npm run build: Builds the app for production.
truffle migrate: Deploys smart contracts to the blockchain.
Future Enhancements
Integration with IPFS: Decentralized storage of user health records.
Cross-chain Support: Expand to other blockchains for lower fees and faster transactions.
Mobile DApp: Create a mobile version of the platform.
